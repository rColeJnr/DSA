1. Initiate the algorithm by marking the source vertex as visited.
2. Check to see if the source is the destination . If it is, you have found a path, so
increment the count by one.
3. If the destination has not be found, get all of the edges adjacent to the source
vertex.
4. For every edge, if it has not been visited before, recursively traverse the
neighboring vertices to find a path to the destination vertex.
5. Remove the source vertex from the visited list so that you can continue to find
other paths to that node.
Youâ€™re doing a depth-first graph traversal. You recursively dive down one path until
you reach the destination, and back-track by popping off the stack. The time-
complexity is O(V + E).*/
